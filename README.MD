Project was developed to utilise aws services and apis as part of AWS Cloud System Development
of Cloud Computing poroject.

 This project was completed individually, deployed and demonstrated to the tutor, however due to the
 aws's account credit and term limitation this project can no longer be accessed through cloud.

 The following services were successfully implemented:
 -Elastic beanstalk
 -Lambda
 -Dynamo DB
 -EC2
 -CloudFront
 -S3 Bucket

Doc_Images contains project's services and apis that were successfully implemented as the project
